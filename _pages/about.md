My primary research Interests
----
- **AI in Healthcare**, including medical computer vision, semantic segmentation, disease classification, and generalization across clinical imaging modalities  
- **Semantic Communication**, involving task-oriented information representation and learning-driven transmission protocols that prioritize meaning over raw data, with applications in next-generation wireless systems
- **Generative AI**, including diffusion-based and transformer-based models for structured data generation, signal reconstruction, and data-efficient representation learning across vision and communication domains
- **Large Language Models (LLMs)**, with focus on robustness, alignment, and their integration into real-world systems for decision support, semantic communication, and adaptive reasoning across safety-critical domains
- **Computer Vision**, covering structured visual understanding, scene perception, and dense prediction for real-world and multi-modal environments
- **Robust Machine Learning**, with emphasis on adversarial safety, generalization under distribution shifts, and data-efficient learning across vision and language domains
